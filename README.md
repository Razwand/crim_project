Profile Images and Data can be downloaded choosing between man/woman profiles and the folder where they will be stored.
Also, in order to perform a smaller search, there's an option to perform a search considering just a few random letters (corresponding to surname search).
### How to

In the following scenario user is searching for men, storing results in folder ./Data/ and the searching procedure will consider one random
letter from the search page (corresponding to all profiles with surname begining with that letter).

```console
scrapping_criminalia>python scrap_img.py
>>Gender (M/W): M
>>Folder to store images: ./Data/
>>Number of letters for searching: 1
